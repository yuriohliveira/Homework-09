# README Generator

## A command-line application that dynamically generates a README file from user input

This application brings the user a tool for more eficiency for his projects. When running the application, the user is given a set of prompts, which will gather all the information needed for the readme.md file to be generated. It also grabs the user's github profile, avatar and email, along with a badge for the license.

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You must also download Inquirer and Axios, which you can do by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). 

## Usage 

From the terminal, run `node index.js`. Then, answer each question with the proper information. When all prompts are completed, a readme file is automatically generated.
